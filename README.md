# ExoArm OpenSim Simulation

This project simulates a simplified human arm with cable-based actuation using OpenSim 4.4 and Python.

## Features
- Upper arm and forearm with anatomically-inspired proportions
- Fingers modeled with joints and PathActuator-based movement
- Cables simulate pulling from an upper arm ring to the forearm and fingers
- Includes damping via torque actuators

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.20
- OpenSim 4.4
- Conda environment named opensim
